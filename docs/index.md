# SoftPotato Documentation

Welcome to the SoftPotato v3.0 documentation.

This documentation currently covers:

- **M0 — Project Skeleton**
- **M1 — Time Grids & Potential Waveforms**

Later milestones will introduce diffusion, kinetics, and electrochemical mechanisms.

---

## What Exists Today

### M0: Project Skeleton
- Installable Python package
- Version metadata
- Passing test suite
- Roadmap and architecture defined

### M1: Time Grids & Waveforms
- Validated time grids
- Potential waveform generators
- Canonical waveform data format
- Validation helpers

---

## What Does Not Exist Yet

- Electrochemical mechanisms (E, EC, CE, …)
- Diffusion solvers
- Kinetics models
- Current calculations
- Plotting utilities
- CLI or GUI
- File I/O

---

## How to Get Started

See `docs/quickstart.md` for the M1 workflow.

---

## Roadmap

Development follows explicit milestones.
Refer to `ROADMAP.md` for scope and sequencing.

---

## Audience

SoftPotato is designed for:

- Electrochemists
- Physical chemists
- Scientific Python users

No knowledge of the internal codebase is required.
